# Image Readability Test Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Test different image dimensions to find the best size for Discord readability with your full analysis text.

## ðŸ“‹ Current Situation
- **Current images**: 3600px wide (too wide, hard to read in Discord preview)
- **Problem**: Users have to click to open, then zoom to read
- **Solution**: Find optimal dimensions for readable Discord preview

## ðŸ§ª Test Steps

### Step 1: Open HTML Preview
1. Open `analysis_preview.html` in your browser
2. Click anywhere to cycle through different widths:
   - 900px (mobile portrait style)
   - 1200px (recommended)
   - 1400px (large square style)
   - 1800px (wide format)

### Step 2: Evaluate Readability
For each size, consider:
- âœ… Is the text large enough to read?
- âœ… Does the layout look professional?
- âœ… Would this work well in Discord preview?
- âœ… Is there enough contrast and spacing?

### Step 3: Screenshot Test
1. Take screenshots of each size from your browser
2. Upload them to Discord to test preview readability
3. Compare with your current 3600px wide images

## ðŸ“Š Recommended Dimensions Based on Analysis

### Option A: Tall Narrow (Recommended)
- **Size**: 1200px x 2000px
- **Pros**: Text stays readable, fits Discord well
- **Font**: 15px base text
- **Best for**: Lengthy analysis text

### Option B: Large Square  
- **Size**: 1400px x 1400px
- **Pros**: Good balance, modern look
- **Font**: 17px base text
- **Best for**: Mixed content (text + stats)

### Option C: Mobile Portrait
- **Size**: 900px x 1600px
- **Pros**: Phone-friendly, very readable
- **Font**: 12px base text
- **Best for**: Simple layouts

## ðŸš€ Next Steps After Testing

1. **Choose winning dimensions** from your Discord tests
2. **Update the HTML template** with optimal sizing
3. **Integrate with your analysis script** to generate images
4. **Test the full workflow**: Analysis â†’ Image â†’ Discord

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- **Discord scales images down** - make text larger than you think
- **Contrast is crucial** - dark text on light background
- **White space helps** - don't cram too much content
- **Test on mobile** - many users view Discord on phones

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- Current template uses responsive design
- Font sizes scale with container width
- Layout adjusts for different aspect ratios
- Ready for integration with your MCP analysis

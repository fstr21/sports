*Generated: August 25, 2025 - 12:50 AM ET*

## 🎯 User Concerns Addressed

### ✅ SOLVED: Team Records & Odds Missing
**Issue**: "we haev no records or odd lines still for the teams"

**Solution**: Updated Discord bot to include comprehensive team data:
```
📊 TEAM RECORDS & ODDS
**Red Sox**: 75-65 (.536) | +145 (40.8%)
**Yankees**: 82-58 (.586) | -165 (62.3%)
```

**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Team records and odds now appear in:
- Discord text summary embed
- Dark enhanced analysis image
- All template data populated correctly

### ⚠️ IDENTIFIED: Expert Count Limitation
**Issue**: "our summary is much more limited now, how about now try to run it with more than 1 agent lets see what happens if we can run 4"

**Root Cause**: Custom Chronulus MCP server limitation
- Discord bot correctly requests 4 experts (`"expert_count": 4`)
- MCP server always returns only 1 expert regardless of request
- Tested 5 different parameter configurations - all return 1 expert
- Server-side limitation, not Discord bot issue

**Current Status**: 
- Expert Count Requested: 4
- Expert Count Received: 1  
- Analysis Length: ~1,400 characters (limited)

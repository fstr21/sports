- **Team Role**: Primary scorer and facilitator for NY Liberty
- **Overall Impact**: 20.4 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.5 SPG
- **Team Record**: 18-10 (Liberty are 1st seed)

## Bet Analysis: Under 18.5 Points

### ‚ùå **AVOID THIS BET** - Here's Why:

## Factors Against the Under:

### 1. **Season Average is Above the Line**
- Ionescu averages **20.4 PPG** this season
- The line is set at 18.5, giving 1.9 points of cushion
- She's been the Liberty's primary offensive weapon

### 2. **Favorable Matchup vs Dallas**
- Dallas allows **86.6 PPG** (poor defense)
- Dallas is 8-21 overall, 3-11 on the road
- Liberty are 12-3 at home where they score more freely
- This should be a comfortable win where starters get good minutes

### 3. **Team Context Favors Scoring**
- Liberty average 86.9 PPG (4th in league)
- They shoot 45.3% FG (3rd in league) 
- Elite 34.7% from three (2nd in league)
- Ionescu is their best shooter and primary option

### 4. **Game Script Likely Favors Her**
- Liberty are heavy favorites (should be leading most of game)
- When ahead, they'll run their offense through Ionescu
- Dallas's poor road record suggests they may not keep it close

## Factors That Could Support the Under:

### 1. **Potential Blowout Scenario**
- If Liberty build a huge lead, Ionescu might sit in 4th quarter
- But even in limited minutes, she could hit 18.5 early

### 2. **Facilitator Role**
- She averages 5.6 assists, sometimes prioritizes playmaking
- But she's still their #1 scoring option

### 3. **Shooting Variance**
- Any player can have an off shooting night
- But her consistency suggests this is unlikely

## Historical Context from Available Data:

From the limited game data I could access:
- In a preseason game vs Connecticut, she had 6 assists (showing her playmaking)
- She's consistently been the team's leading scorer
- Liberty's offensive system runs through her

## Final Recommendation:

### üö® **AVOID THE UNDER 18.5** 

**Confidence Level**: 75% avoid

**Reasoning**:
1. **Season average (20.4) is significantly above the line**
2. **Favorable matchup** against poor Dallas defense
3. **Home court advantage** where Liberty score more
4. **Primary offensive role** on a high-scoring team
5. **Game script** likely favors her getting good minutes and shots

## Alternative Bet Suggestions:

Instead of the under, consider:
- **Ionescu Over 4.5 Assists** (she averages 5.6)
- **Ionescu Over 1.5 Three-Pointers Made** (team shoots 34.7% from three)
- **Liberty Team Total Over** (they average 86.9 PPG vs poor Dallas defense)

## Risk Factors to Monitor:

- **Injury/Rest**: Check if she's listed on injury report
- **Foul Trouble**: Early fouls could limit minutes
- **Blowout**: Massive lead could mean 4th quarter rest

---

**Bottom Line**: Ionescu averaging 20.4 PPG against a line of 18.5 is not good value for the under. The matchup, home court, and her role all suggest she should comfortably exceed this number. I'd look elsewhere for betting value in this game.

# Let's Run This Together - Step by Step

## What We're Testing
- Can we get Liverpool players + recent stats?
- How many API calls does it actually take?
- Is the data quality good enough for betting analysis?

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: You Run the Setup
```bash
cd C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\soccer_testing
npm install @yeonupark/mcp-soccer-data@latest
set SOCCERDATA_API_KEY=a9f37754a540df435e8c40ed89c08565166524ed
npx @yeonupark/mcp-soccer-data@latest
```

**Expected Output**: Server running on localhost:3000

### Step 2: You Run Our Test
In a new terminal:
```bash
python test_single_team_mcp.py
```

**What You'll See**:
1. Menu asking for Strategy 1 or 2
2. Confirmation before each API call
3. JSON files created with results
4. Analysis of player data quality

### Step 3: Share Results With Me
Copy and paste:
1. **Terminal output** - so I can see what happened
2. **JSON file contents** - so I can analyze the data structure
3. **Any errors** - so I can help troubleshoot

## What I'm Looking For
- **Player data structure**: What fields are available?
- **Stats included**: Goals, assists, appearances, minutes played?
- **Recent data**: Is it current season stats?
- **Data quality**: Detailed enough for betting analysis?

## Alternative If MCP Fails
If the Node.js MCP server doesn't work, we can test directly:
```bash
python test_soccerdataapi.py --endpoint leagues
```

## Questions I'll Answer From Results
1. **Is this worth pursuing?** Based on data quality
2. **How many calls for full coverage?** EPL + La Liga + MLS
3. **Better than Football-Data.org?** Comparison analysis
4. **Integration strategy**: Replace or supplement current Soccer MCP

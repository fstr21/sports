# SoccerDataAPI Call Strategy Analysis

## The Challenge: Player Stats with 75 Call Limit

### 🎯 **Your Goal**
Get players and recent stats for:
- EPL teams
- La Liga teams  
- MLS teams

### 📊 **API Call Chain Required**

Based on documentation, it appears we need this chain:
1. **Leagues** → Get league IDs (1 call)
2. **Teams** → Get team IDs for each league (3 calls: EPL, La Liga, MLS)
3. **Players** → Get player data per team (MANY calls - 20+ teams per league)

### ⚠️ **Call Estimation**

**For just EPL (20 teams):**
- 1 call for leagues
- 1 call for EPL teams
- 20 calls for team rosters = **22 calls total**

**For all three leagues (EPL + La Liga + MLS):**
- Estimated **60+ calls minimum**
- That's almost your entire daily limit!

### 🤔 **Critical Questions to Test First**

We need to find out:
1. **Can we get team rosters directly?** (teams endpoint might include players)
2. **Does players endpoint give stats?** (or just basic info)
3. **Is there a bulk players endpoint?** (get multiple players at once)

### 🧪 **Smart Testing Strategy**

**Phase 1: Test One Team Only (3 calls max)**
1. Get leagues (1 call) - find EPL league ID
2. Get EPL teams (1 call) - find Liverpool team ID  
3. Get Liverpool players (1 call) - see what data we get

**Phase 2: Evaluate Data Quality**
- Do we get recent stats or just names?
- Is the data sufficient for betting analysis?
- Does it include positions, goals, assists, etc.?

### 🎯 **Conservative Test Plan**

**Option A: Single Team Test (3 calls)**
```python
# 1. Get leagues → find EPL ID
# 2. Get EPL teams → find Liverpool ID
# 3. Get Liverpool roster → see player data structure
```

**Option B: Direct Team Approach (2 calls)**
```python
# If we can guess/know team IDs:
# 1. Get Liverpool roster directly (team_id=XXX)
# 2. Get Barcelona roster directly (team_id=XXX)
```

**Option C: Research Known IDs (1 call)**
```python
# If Liverpool team_id is known (like 50), test:
# 1. Get Liverpool roster only
```

### 🔍 **Key Questions for First Test**

1. **Does teams endpoint include player lists?**
2. **Does player data include recent stats?**
3. **Are there bulk endpoints we're missing?**

### 💡 **Recommendation**

**Start with 1 single call:** Test getting one team's roster (Liverpool) to see:
- Data structure
- Whether stats are included
- Quality of player information

This tells us if the API is worth pursuing before burning more calls.

### 🚨 **Alternative Approach**

**Check if MCP server has optimizations:**
- Maybe the Node.js MCP server batches calls
- Might have caching to reduce API usage
- Could provide bulk endpoints not in docs

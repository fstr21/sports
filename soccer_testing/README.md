# Soccer Data Source Testing

## Purpose
Isolated testing environment for a new soccer data source. This folder is completely separate from the existing production Soccer MCP that uses Football-Data.org.

## Current Production Soccer MCP
- **Source**: Football-Data.org API v4
- **Coverage**: EPL + La Liga only (free tier limitation)
- **Location**: `mcp_leagues/soccer/`
- **Status**: Operational but limited

## This Testing Environment
- **Purpose**: Test new soccer data source
- **Isolation**: No interaction with existing systems
- **Safety**: Local testing only, no deployment

## Files
- This folder is ready for your new soccer data source testing
- Add any scripts, configurations, or test files here
- Completely isolated from production systems

## Instructions
1. Add your new soccer data source files here
2. Test locally without affecting existing systems
3. Document findings and capabilities
4. Compare with existing Football-Data.org source
5. Decide on integration strategy after testing

## Notes
- No MCP server deployment needed initially
- Pure local testing environment
- Safe to experiment without breaking anything

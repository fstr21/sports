# Sports Betting Analysis System - Project Status

## 🎯 **PROJECT GOAL**

Create a comprehensive sports betting analysis system with the following architecture:

```
User (Natural Language) → Client → MCP Server → ESPN API → OpenRouter AI → Predictions & Analysis
                                 ↓
                              Wagyu MCP → Odds API → Live Betting Data
```

### **Target Sports & Seasons**
- **NFL**: Pre-season, Regular season, Post-season
- **NCAAF**: College Football (all seasons)
- **NBA**: Pre-season, Regular season, Post-season  
- **NCAAB**: College Basketball (all seasons)
- **WNBA**: Regular season, Post-season
- **MLB**: Pre-season, Regular season, Post-season
- **NHL**: Pre-season, Regular season, Post-season
- **MLS**: Major League Soccer
- **EPL**: English Premier League
- **La Liga**: Spanish La Liga

### **Required Data Types**
1. **Completed Games**: Scores, event IDs, player stats, team stats
2. **Future Games**: Schedules, matchups, predictions
3. **Live Betting Odds**: Moneylines, spreads, totals
4. **AI Predictions**: OpenRouter-powered analysis and recommendations

### **Core Requirements**
- ❌ **NO direct ESPN API calls from client**
- ❌ **NO mock or hallucinated data**
- ✅ **All data through MCP architecture**
- ✅ **Natural language queries**
- ✅ **Real-time betting odds**
- ✅ **AI-powered predictions**

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

### ✅ **COMPLETED COMPONENTS**

#### **1. MCP Server (sports_ai_mcp.py)**
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional ESPN API wrapper
- **Capabilities**:
  - `getScoreboard`: Fetch games for any supported league
  - `getGameSummary`: Detailed game stats with player/team data
  - `getTeams`: Team information
  - `probeLeagueSupport`: Validate league availability
  - `analyzeGameStrict`: AI analysis with no hallucinations
- **Supported Sports**: NFL, WNBA, NBA, MLB, NHL, NCAAF, NCAAB, MLS, EPL, La Liga
- **Data Validation**: Strict ESPN-only data, no fabrication
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Built-in AI analysis capabilities

#### **2. Wagyu MCP (Betting Odds)**
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Capabilities**: Live betting odds from major sportsbooks
- **Markets**: Moneylines, spreads, totals
- **Coverage**: All target sports

#### **3. ESPN Client (espn_client.py)**
- **Status**: ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Legacy ESPN wrapper
- **Purpose**: Legacy bridge - replaced by MCP-only architecture
- **Migration**: All functionality moved to clients/core_mcp.py
- **Functions**: `get_scoreboard()`, `get_game_summary()`

#### **4. Data Formatting & Display**
- **Status**: ✅ ESPN-quality formatting
- **Capabilities**:
  - QB Statistics: C/ATT, YDS, AVG, TD, INT, SACKS, RTG
  - RB Statistics: CAR, YDS, AVG, TD, LONG
  - WR Statistics: REC, YDS, AVG, TD, LONG, TGTS
  - Multi-position support in single queries

---

### 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

#### **1. Client-MCP Integration (sports_analysis.py)**
- **Current Issue**: Client still makes some direct ESPN calls
- **Working On**: Converting all ESPN calls to proper MCP tool calls
- **Progress**: 70% complete
  - ✅ Sport detection working
  - ✅ Query parsing working  
  - ✅ Position-specific stats working
  - 🚧 MCP tool integration (replacing direct calls)

#### **2. Natural Language Processing**
- **Status**: Basic implementation working
- **Capabilities**:
  - ✅ Sport detection ("ravens vs colts" → NFL)
  - ✅ Position detection ("qb stats", "running backs", "receivers")
  - ✅ Team name recognition
  - 🚧 Advanced query parsing (predictions, future games)

---

### ❌ **STILL NEEDED**

#### **1. Complete MCP Architecture**
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - MCP-only architecture implemented
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  ```python
  # Migration completed:
  # OLD: requests.get("https://site.api.espn.com/...")
  # NEW: from clients.core_mcp import scoreboard, game_summary
  #      result = await scoreboard('nfl', date='20240815')
  ```
- **Details**: All ESPN API calls now flow through sports_ai_mcp.py server

#### **2. Prediction Engine**
- **Status**: ❌ Not implemented
- **Requirements**:
  - Analyze historical data
  - Consider current team performance
  - Factor in betting odds
  - Generate AI-powered predictions
  - Provide confidence levels

#### **3. Future Games Support**
- **Status**: ❌ Limited implementation
- **Requirements**:
  - Upcoming game schedules
  - Matchup analysis
  - Pre-game predictions
  - Injury reports integration

#### **4. Enhanced League Coverage**
- **Current**: Basic support for all target sports
- **Needed**: 
  - Season type detection (pre/regular/post)
  - League-specific stat categories
  - International soccer leagues (EPL, La Liga)
  - College sports integration

#### **5. Advanced Analytics**
- **Status**: ❌ Not implemented
- **Requirements**:
  - Team performance trends
  - Player efficiency metrics
  - Head-to-head comparisons
  - Betting value analysis

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DEBT**

1. **Duplicate ESPN Logic**: Both client and MCP have ESPN integration
2. **Missing MCP Client**: No proper MCP client implementation
3. **Limited Error Handling**: Need better fallback mechanisms
4. **Performance**: Multiple API calls could be optimized

- ✅ **ESPN-Quality Formatting**: Professional display (ACHIEVED)
- ✅ **Multi-Sport Support**: 10+ leagues (ACHIEVED)
- 🚧 **Pure MCP Architecture**: No direct API calls (IN PROGRESS)
- ❌ **AI Predictions**: OpenRouter-powered analysis (PENDING)

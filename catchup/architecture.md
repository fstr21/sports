Multi-Sport MCP Architecture: Single Service Model
Overview:
In this architecture, we will host multiple sport-specific MCPs (Model Context Protocols) under a single service. The service will be responsible for routing requests based on the sport, processing the data, and then returning results via JSON-RPC. Each sport will have its own set of tools, but all of them will be managed and deployed from one central service. The focus will be on building the overall MCP architecture first, and then adding sport-specific tools gradually.

Phase 1: Set Up the Core MCP Framework
Service Setup
Service Name: sports-web

Platform: Railway (or any cloud provider of your choice)

Framework: Starlette + Uvicorn for the backend

Protocol: JSON-RPC (over HTTP POST) for inter-service communication

Endpoint: /mcp for all requests (common entry point for all sports)

The idea is to design the core framework where multiple sports’ MCPs can coexist and interact with their specific data sources while sharing common utilities. This core will handle requests for any sport (like Baseball, Football, etc.) and dispatch them to the correct handler.

Initial Steps:
Create the Core Service:

Set up a basic Starlette server with Uvicorn.

Design the /mcp endpoint to accept JSON-RPC requests, which will be routed to sport-specific tools.

Define Core Utilities:

Common utilities like caching, rate-limiting, or backoff mechanisms should be set up at this stage so that they can be used across all sports.

Implement shared data fetching mechanisms that can be re-used, such as functions for making API calls, parsing data, or handling time zones (e.g., converting dates to ET).

Routing Setup:

Set up a routing mechanism that allows the service to distinguish between sports.

Example routes might look like:

/mcp/baseball for baseball-related requests

/mcp/basketball for basketball-related requests

/mcp/soccer for soccer-related requests

/mcp/odds for the betting odds data

Each route will handle requests specific to that sport.

Phase 2: Develop the Sport-Specific Tools
Once the basic architecture is in place, the next step is to focus on building out the sport-specific tools. Here’s the recommended approach:

Baseball MCP Tools (Example)
Get MLB Schedule (ET):

Use the MLB Stats API to fetch the game schedule for a specific day (in Eastern Time).

Tool: getMLBScheduleET

Get MLB Teams:

Fetch the active teams for the current season.

Tool: getMLBTeams

Get MLB Team Roster:

Fetch the roster for a specific team, including player details.

Tool: getMLBTeamRoster

Get MLB Player Stats (Last N Games):

Fetch the last N games of a specific player’s performance.

Tool: getMLBPlayerLastN

Get MLB Player Prop Stats:

Fetch player-specific prop betting statistics (hits, HRs, RBIs, etc.).

Tool: getMLBPlayerPropStats

Basketball MCP Tools (Future)
As we expand to basketball, we’ll follow a similar process:

Get NBA Schedule:

Fetch the NBA game schedule.

Tool: getNBAScheduleET

Get NBA Teams:

Fetch the active teams for the season.

Tool: getNBATeams

Get NBA Player Game Log:

Fetch the last N games for a specific NBA player.

Tool: getNBAPlayerGameLog

Get NBA Player Props:

Fetch prop betting statistics (points, assists, rebounds, etc.).

Tool: getNBAPlayerProps

Phase 3: Scaling and Adding More Sports
Once the baseball and basketball tools are implemented, we can continue expanding to other sports such as NFL and Soccer. Each new sport will follow the same steps:

Create a Service for Each Sport:

Instead of creating entirely separate services, we will add more tools within the single service.

Each sport will get a dedicated handler and set of tools but reside under the same service.

Example: /mcp/nfl will handle all NFL-related requests, while /mcp/soccer will handle soccer-specific requests.

Scale as Needed:

As each sport's tools become more complex or require more traffic, you can scale the service horizontally or partition resources.

Utilize the cloud platform's scaling features (like Railway’s auto-scaling) to handle varying traffic demands.

Core Benefits of This Approach
Centralized Management: By hosting multiple sports under one service, we have a single point of deployment and management. It simplifies CI/CD pipelines and overall maintenance.

Cost Efficiency: Instead of spinning up multiple services for each sport, you minimize costs by consolidating all tools in one service, sharing resources across sports.

Modular Expansion: New sports can be added easily without impacting existing functionality. Each sport’s tools are isolated from others, making future updates straightforward.

Shared Utilities: Common utilities like caching, rate limiting, or API clients can be reused, reducing code duplication and simplifying maintenance.

Simplified Routing: Using a routing mechanism in a single service, we can keep requests specific to the relevant sport, ensuring the service remains flexible and easily extensible.

Example Request Flow:
A user wants to get the MLB schedule for a given day.

They send a request to /mcp/baseball.

The server checks the routing logic, sees that it’s a baseball request, and directs it to the appropriate tool (getMLBScheduleET).

The tool fetches the data from the MLB Stats API, processes it, and returns the result via JSON-RPC.

Next Steps:
Complete the Framework: Focus on setting up the base service with core routing, utilities, and shared components.

Develop the Tools for Baseball: Implement the tools specific to baseball and ensure they work as expected with the MLB Stats API.

Add Additional Sports: As demand grows, begin implementing additional sports and their respective tools.

Final Thoughts
This architecture is designed for scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. Starting with the base framework ensures that we don’t get ahead of ourselves by adding too many sports-specific tools too early. We can gradually expand as the project grows and requirements evolve. By focusing on building the MCP framework first, we ensure that our service can handle multiple sports while keeping everything modular and easy to manage.

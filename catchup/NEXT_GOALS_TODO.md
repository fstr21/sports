# ðŸŽ¯ Next Goals & TODO List

## ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY - Discord Analysis Quality Enhancement

### Discord Analysis Truncation Issue - RESOLVED âœ…
- [x] **Fixed Discord Analysis Truncation Problem**
  - **Issue**: Discord was losing 61.9% of expert analysis text due to Discord field limits (1024 chars)
  - **Solution**: Enhanced truncation logic in `enhanced_chronulus_integration.py` to preserve critical sections
  - **Key Fix**: Prioritizes Final Assessment (probabilities, confidence, recommendation) over verbose middle sections
  - **Result**: Now preserves 48.8% of analysis including all actionable intelligence
  - **Quality Target**: Match comprehensive analysis from `chronulus/results/comprehensive_analysis_20250824_014206.md`

### Custom Chronulus AI Integration - IN PROGRESS ðŸ”§
- [x] **Enhanced Chronulus Integration Created**
  - Location: `mcp_leagues/discord_bot/enhanced_chronulus_integration.py` 
  - Uses comprehensive game data exactly like successful test script
  - Integrated with Discord bot via mlb_handler.py updates
  - **Current Status**: Analysis content preserved but could explore alternative Discord formats
  - **Target Output**: Match quality of comprehensive test analysis (1,265 characters â†’ preserve key insights)

- [ ] **MLB Totals Integration - CRITICAL MISSING PIECE**
  - **Current Issue**: MLB analysis missing Over/Under totals and lines
  - **Required**: Get O/U lines from Odds API (e.g., "Over 8.5 (-110)", "Under 8.5 (-105)")
  - **Integration Point**: `mcp_leagues/discord_bot/sports/mlb_handler.py` betting grid
  - **Current Grid**: Only has Moneyline and Run Line - needs totals row
  - **Data Source**: Odds MCP already supports totals market - just needs integration
  - **Format**: Match existing betting line format in Discord embeds

### Discord Format Optimization - POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS ðŸ’¡
- [ ] **Explore Alternative Discord Embed Formats**
  - **Current Limitation**: Single Discord field limited to 1024 characters
  - **Options to Consider**:
    1. **Multi-Field Analysis**: Split analysis across multiple Discord fields
    2. **Separate Analysis Embed**: Create dedicated embed for expert analysis 
    3. **Collapsible Sections**: Use Discord spoiler tags for detailed sections
    4. **Linked Full Report**: Generate markdown file and provide link

# Hybrid WNBA Data System Plan

## 🎯 **Strategy: Best of Both Worlds**

### **ESPN API (Current System) - For:**
✅ **Real-time game data**
- Live scores and schedules
- Game status updates
- Team matchups

✅ **Team information**
- Team rosters and basic info
- Team records and standings
- Team news and updates

✅ **League-wide data**
- Injury reports
- News articles
- General statistics

### **Web Scraping MCP - For:**
✅ **Individual player stats**
- Season averages (PPG, RPG, APG)
- Advanced metrics (PER, TS%, Usage)
- Career statistics
- Game logs

✅ **Detailed player profiles**
- Biographical information
- Career history
- Awards and achievements

## 🔧 **Implementation Options**

### **Option 1: Find Existing Scraping MCP**
Look for existing MCP servers that can scrape:
- ESPN.com player pages
- Basketball-Reference WNBA section
- WNBA.com official stats

### **Option 2: Build Custom Scraping MCP**
Create a specialized scraper for:
```
Target Sites:
• ESPN.com/wnba/player/_/id/{player_id}
• Basketball-reference.com/wnba/players/
• WNBA.com player profiles
```

### **Option 3: Hybrid MCP Server**
Combine both approaches in one server:
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def get_wnba_data(query: str, include_player_stats: bool = False):
    # Use ESPN API for basic data
    basic_data = await espn_client.get_data(query)
    
    # Use scraping for player stats if requested
    if include_player_stats:
        player_data = await scraper.get_player_stats(query)
        return combine_data(basic_data, player_data)
    
    return basic_data
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Immediate (Keep Current System)**
Your ESPN API MCP is working great for:
- Game scores and schedules
- Team information
- Injuries and news
- League updates

### **Phase 2 (Add Player Stats)**
1. **Research existing scraping MCPs**
   - Check MCP registry for sports scrapers
   - Look for ESPN or basketball scrapers

2. **Evaluate scraping targets**
   - ESPN.com player pages (rich data)
   - Basketball-Reference (historical data)
   - WNBA.com (official stats)

3. **Choose implementation**
   - Separate scraping MCP + current ESPN MCP
   - OR combined hybrid server

## 🚀 **Sample Queries After Adding Scraping**

### **Current ESPN API Queries (Working Now)**
- "Show me today's WNBA scores"
- "Las Vegas Aces team info"
- "WNBA injury report"
- "Latest WNBA news"

### **Future Player Stats Queries (Need Scraping)**
- "A'ja Wilson season stats"
- "Sabrina Ionescu career averages"
- "Top WNBA scorers this season"
- "Breanna Stewart game log"
- "WNBA MVP candidates stats"

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Start with what works**: Your ESPN API system is solid
2. **Add scraping incrementally**: Don't rebuild everything
3. **Consider rate limits**: Web scraping needs to be respectful
4. **Cache player data**: Stats don't change as frequently as scores
5. **Fallback strategy**: If scraping fails, gracefully degrade

## 🔍 **Research Tasks**

1. Check if any existing MCP servers can scrape ESPN player pages
2. Investigate WNBA.com for potential APIs or scrapeable data
3. Test Basketball-Reference WNBA section structure
4. Evaluate effort vs. benefit for different scraping targets

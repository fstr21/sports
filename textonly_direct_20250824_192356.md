Chief Sports Analyst â€¢ google/gemini-2.0-flash-001

**MARKET BASELINE**: The current moneyline implies approximately 42.4% probability for Boston and 61.8% for New York.

**ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT**: Based on the provided data, the market appears reasonably efficient, but a slight edge towards Boston is suggested.

**KEY FACTORS FROM DATA**: Boston's slightly superior record (71-59 vs. 69-60) and marginally better run differential (+105 vs. +96) indicate a potential for outperformance relative to market expectations. Both teams having identical 6-4 form in their last 10 games also supports a close contest.

**BASEBALL VARIANCE ACKNOWLEDGMENT**: Given baseball's inherent unpredictability and the relatively small differences in team performance metrics, extreme confidence is not warranted.

**DIRECTIONAL ASSESSMENT**: While the Yankees are playing at home, Boston's slightly stronger overall performance warrants a minor adjustment. With moderate confidence, I assess the Red Sox win probability at 47.4%.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
Win Probability: 35.0% (Boston Red Sox (71-59, .546 win%, AL East))
Analyst Confidence: 60%
Recommendation: BET HOME - Strong edge identified\n```\n\n---\n\n*This is a direct test of the /textonly command logic to verify Custom Chronulus MCP integration.*\n

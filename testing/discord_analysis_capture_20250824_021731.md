**MARKET BASELINE**: The current moneyline implies approximately 40.8% probability for Boston and 62.3% for New York.

**ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT**: Based on available data, the market appears reasonably efficient, but a few factors suggest slightly higher odds for the Yankees.

**KEY FACTORS FROM DATA**: New York's superior home record (43-26) and recent form (7-3 L10), combined with a significant +89 run differential, indicates an advantage. Boston's road record of 35-35 is mediocre.

**BASEBALL VARIANCE ACKNOWLEDGMENT**: Baseball's inherent unpredictability means any single game outcome remains subject to variance, limiting the certainty of any projection.

**DIRECTIONAL ASSESSMENT**: While acknowledging the risks, New York's overall strength and home-field advantage justify a slight adjustment upward. This yields a Boston Red Sox win probability of 38%.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
Win Probability: 35.0% (Boston Red Sox (75-65, .0.536 win%, Wild Card contention))
Analyst Confidence: 75%
Recommendation: BET HOME - Strong edge identified\n```\n\n**Full Analysis Length**: 1240 characters\n\n### Analysis Metadata\n\n- **Away Probability**: 0.35\n- **Home Probability**: 0.65\n- **Market Edge**: -0.05816326530612248\n- **Recommendation**: BET HOME\n- **Expert Count**: 1\n- **Model**: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001\n- **Cost**: $0.02-$0.05\n\n---\n\n## ‚öñÔ∏è Discord vs Full Analysis Comparison\n\n### Length Comparison\n\n- **Full Analysis**: 1240 characters\n- **Discord Shows**: 473 characters\n- **Truncated**: 767 characters lost\n\n### Content Comparison\n\n**What Discord Shows:**\n```\nBoston Red Sox (75-65, .0.536 win%, Wild Card contention) @ New York Yankees (82-58, .0.586 win%, AL East leaders)

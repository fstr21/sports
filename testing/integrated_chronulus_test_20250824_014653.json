The Rockies' significantly higher runs allowed per game is a notable concern.\n\n**BASEBALL VARIANCE ACKNOWLEDGMENT**: Baseball's inherent randomness prevents high-confidence predictions, as any single game can deviate significantly from season-long trends.\n\n**DIRECTIONAL ASSESSMENT**: While acknowledging the inherent variance, the Pirates' statistical advantages warrant a slight adjustment. We assess the Colorado Rockies' win probability at 44.0%.\n\nFINAL ASSESSMENT:\nWin Probability: 42.0% (Colorado Rockies (37-93, ..285 win%))\nAnalyst Confidence: 75%\nRecommendation: LEAN HOME",

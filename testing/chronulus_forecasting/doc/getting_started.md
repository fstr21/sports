At Chronulus AI, we are proud to bring you the first and only fully agentic forecasting and prediction platform. The Chronulus SDK is your access point to our platform.

What is "Agentic"?
Agentic AI systems are designed to exert some level of autonomous actions or decision-making to accomplish a goal for a user. Agents are able to:

use multiple types of inputs (modalities) such as text and image
access and use tools (software packages, APIs, search engines, etc.) to accomplish work
interact with other agents to delegate, distill, verify, challenge, and approve work
What is a Prediction Agent?
A Chronulus Prediction Agent is designed to autonomously consider, research, and return an estimate to a user along with a written explanation of what it considered while forming the estimate.

What is a Forecasting Agent?
A Chronulus Forecasting Agent is a type of Prediction Agent that is specifically designed to return a series of predictions over a time horizon (the forecast horizon) defined by you, the user.

What Agents does Chronulus provide?
The Chronulus SDK provided access to 2 agents:

NormalizedForecaster - Our first forecasting agent, provides zero-shot, cold-start forecasts with multi-modal inputs.
BinaryPredictor - Our first prediction agent, provides probability estimates for questions with binary outcomes (What is the probability X will happen?).
Additional agents are currently in development and evaluation and will be added to the SDK as we make them available to the public.

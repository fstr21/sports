# Chronulus for Sports Betting - Complete Analysis

## 🎯 **Understanding Chronulus (From Your Documentation)**

### **Core Concept:**
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous decision-making with multi-modal inputs (text + images)
- **Two Main Agents**:
  - `BinaryPredictor`: Probability estimates for binary outcomes (perfect for "Will Team X win?")
  - `NormalizedForecaster`: Time-series predictions (perfect for "How will betting odds change over time?")

### **Key Components:**
1. **Session**: Defines situation/task context
2. **Input Schema**: Structured data model (your sports data)
3. **Agent**: Makes predictions with expert panel consensus
4. **Results**: Probabilities + detailed explanations

## 🏈 **Sports Betting Applications**

### **Perfect Use Cases for Your Data:**

### **1. Binary Game Predictions (BinaryPredictor)**
```python
# Question: "Will Alaves beat Real Betis?"
# Your data → Probability + detailed reasoning
# Output: 0.65 probability (65% chance) + explanation
```

### **2. Time-Series Odds Forecasting (NormalizedForecaster)**
```python
# Question: "How will betting odds change over next 24 hours?"
# Your data → Hourly odds predictions
# Output: Time series of expected odds movements
```

Analysis of the Problem
Good News: The system is working! You can see:

âœ… Connected to ESPN server successfully
ðŸ“¡ Found the ESPN tool (test_request)
ðŸ¤– LLM called the ESPN API and got 11,927 characters of NBA data
The first question worked but didn't complete the response

The Issue: There's a connection management problem in the Python script. The SSE connection is being reused incorrectly between questions, causing async context manager conflicts.
Quick Fix: Create a new connection for each question instead of reusing it.

Complete System Summary
What We Built
You have a working LLM â†’ ESPN API pipeline using:

mcp-proxy (running on port 8080) - converts between HTTP and stdio
dkmaker-mcp-rest-api (Node.js MCP server) - connects to ESPN APIs
Python script - connects OpenRouter LLM to ESPN data via function calling

Current Status

âœ… mcp-proxy installed: uv tool install mcp-proxy
âœ… ESPN MCP server installed: npm install -g dkmaker-mcp-rest-api
âœ… Server running: mcp-proxy --port 8080 --env REST_BASE_URL "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports" npx dkmaker-mcp-rest-api
âœ… Python dependencies: pip install openai mcp
âœ… API configuration: OpenRouter key in .env.local
âœ… First API call worked: Successfully got NBA data from ESPN

The Architecture
Your Python Script â†’ OpenRouter API â†’ mcp-proxy (port 8080) â†’ ESPN MCP Server â†’ ESPN API
Files You Have

C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\.env.local (with OpenRouter API key)
C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\mcpproxytest.py (the Python script)

What's Working

ESPN MCP server connects to https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports
mcp-proxy serves at http://127.0.0.1:8080/sse
LLM successfully calls ESPN APIs via function calling
You got real NBA scoreboard data (11,927 characters)

The Fix Needed
The Python script needs to create a new SSE connection for each question instead of reusing connections. The async context manager is conflicting when processing multiple questions in sequence.
Next Steps for Another LLM

Fix the connection reuse issue in the Python script
Parse and display the ESPN data properly
Add error handling for network issues
Optionally create an interactive chat loop

You're 95% there - just need to fix the connection management in the Python script!

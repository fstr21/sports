Sports Expert Analysis
The goal is to make the sports expert analysis output more user-friendly and actionable for quick decision-making. To achieve this, we need to restructure the analysis to focus on clarity, access

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
Bre
Divide long

Example: Instead of a large block of text explaining all the factors, split them into individual points with proper head

Add Sectio
Provide clean

Example: "Key Factors to Consider," "Main Risks," "Final Recommendation."

Include a "Bottom Line" S
At the end of ea

Example: "Based on the data, the Yankees are favored, but if their starting pitcher struggles, the Red Sox could outperform expectations. Bet with caution."

Use Bullet Points for Clarity:
Bullet points are a great way to list multiple considerations or facts clearly and concisely. This makes it easier for users to quickly scan and absorb information.

LANGUAGE SIMPLIFICATION:
Replace Technical Jargon with Plain Language:
Avoid overly technical terms, or if necessary, explain them briefly in simpler terms.

Example: If you mention "moneyline" or "home-field advantage," briefly explain what they mean (eg, "Moneyline refers to the odds for each team to win without considering the spread.").

Explain Betting Terms:
For terms like "moneyline," "spread," or "home-field advantage," include short, simple explanations in parentheses so the user knows exactly what these terms imply.

Example: "The moneyline (odds on who will win the game) currently favors the Yankees at -168."

Focus on Outcomes and Implications:
Avoid going into excessive detail about methodology or technical analysis. Instead, focus on the results and implications for betting decisions.

Example: "The Yankees are favored, but the Red Sox might surprise if their starter performs well."

Write Conversationally:
Aim for a friendly, accessible tone that explains the analysis as if you're discussing it with a friend. This approach is more engaging and approachable for a wider audience.

Example: "The Yankees have the edge, but don't count out the Red Soxâ€”they could upset if their offense clicks."

CONTENT STRUCTURE PER EXPERT:
Opening Stance (1-2 Sentences):
Begin with a direct statement of the expert's position. For instance, do they favor a particular team, or are there concerns about the bet?

Example: "I think the Yankees are the favorites here, but there's a potential for an upset by the Red Sox if certain factors align."

Key Supporting Factors (Clear Points):
List the factors that support the expert's stance. Use bullet points to keep it organized.

Example:

The Yankees have a strong lineup, but their recent form has been inconsistent.

The Red Sox are capable of surprising if their offense gets going, especially against the Yankees' starter.

Weather conditions could affect gameplay, favoring one team depending on pitcher performance.

Main Risk/Concern (What Could Make Them Wrong):
Highlight the main risk or concern that could lead to a different outcome.

Example: "If the Yankees start their ace pitcher, their chances of winning increase significantly. A surprise performance from the Red Sox could also turn the game in their favor."

Bottom Line (Final Recommendation):
Conclude with a clear, actionable recommendation, based on the expert's analysis.

Example: "Bet on the Yankees to win, but keep an eye on the starting pitcher announcement. The Red Sox are a good underdog pick if they get favorable matchups."

USER-FOCUSED IMPROVEMENTS:
Lead with Actionable Insights:
Start each expert's analysis with a direct, practical recommendation that users can act on. For example: "Bet on Team A if this condition is met, but avoid betting if this happens."

Prioritize Information Impacting Betting Decisions:
Only include the most relevant factors that directly influence the user's betting choices. If certain analysis details are less impactful, simplify or omit them.

Example: Rather than focusing on team history, concentrate on current form and the expected pitching matchup.

Minimize Repetitive Explanations:
Avoid repeating similar concepts across different experts. Each expert should bring a unique perspective without resting the same factors.

Example: If one expert talks about the pitching staff, another could focus on betting trends or team motivation.

End Each Analysis with Clear Directional Guidance:
Always provide clear recommendations at the end of the analysis.

Example: "Favor Team A based on recent form," or "Avoid betting on the Over/Under as the odds are too tight."

LENGTH MANAGEMENT:
Target 4-6 Sentences per Major Point:
Keep each point concise but informative. Avoid excessive detail or filler that doesn't directly impact the user's decision.

Example: "The Yankees are favorites, but they're struggling with their bullpen. A strong start could tip the game in their favor, but their odds don't fully reflect the risks involved."

Eliminate Redundant Phrasing and Filler Words:
Remove words that don't add value. Make each sentence work toward providing actionable information.

Example: Instead of saying "The Yankees have a solid team and are a strong contender, but the Red Sox could also perform well if they get their key players to step up," you can say, "The Yankees are strong but inconsistent, and the Red Sox could surprise if their offense clicks."

Combine Related Concepts into Stronger Statements:
Consolidate ideas that are related into one clear statement for impact.

Example: "The Yankees' home-field advantage and bullpen strength should help them win, but the Red Sox have a chance if their starter performs better."

SUMMARY GOAL:
The aim is to transform academic-style analysis into digestible, actionable betting insights that users can quickly scan, understand, and use. By focusing on clarity , actionability , and concise structure , we make sure users can easily grasp the expert's viewpoint and make informed decisions based on the provided analysis.

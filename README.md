report = analyzer.generate_daily_report(analyses)
print(report)
```

## üìÅ Output Files

- `wnba_analysis_YYYYMMDD.md` - Daily analysis reports
- `daily_reports/latest_analysis.md` - Always contains the most recent analysis
- `wnba_analyzer.log` - System logs and errors

## üéØ Betting Recommendations

The system provides confidence-based recommendations:

- **STRONG** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (80%+ confidence) - High conviction bets
- **MODERATE** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (60-79% confidence) - Solid opportunities
- **LEAN** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (40-59% confidence) - Slight edge
- **AVOID** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (<40% confidence) - Too close to call

## üí° Efficiency Features

### Minimal API Calls

- **1 call** for daily scoreboard (all games)
- **N calls** for team stats (where N = unique teams playing)
- **Total**: Typically 6-12 API calls per day vs 100+ for naive approaches

### Smart Data Processing

- Extracts only essential stats needed for analysis
- Caches team data within single run
- Processes multiple games from single scoreboard call

### Token Optimization

- Focused analysis algorithms (no LLM calls needed)
- Structured output generation
- Minimal text processing

**This System** (per day):

- 6-12 API calls total
- No LLM calls needed
- Minimal token usage
- **Cost**: $0.10-0.50 per day

## üö® Important Notes

- **ESPN API**: Free but rate-limited. Be respectful with requests
- **Betting**: This is for analysis only. Gamble responsibly
- **Data Accuracy**: Always verify important data independently
- **Updates**: WNBA schedule changes may require adjustments

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Encoding Errors**: Files use UTF-8 encoding
2. **No Games Found**: Check date format (YYYYMMDD)
3. **API Errors**: ESPN API may be temporarily unavailable
4. **Permission Errors**: Ensure write permissions for output directory

### Debug Mode

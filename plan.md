The goal of this whole project is to eventually have users subscribe to my discord where every day I will use the remote mcp that we have on railway to 1.  get teh games across multiple sports and leagues, the gamelevel odds for those games (moneyline, spreads, totals) get the player stats for those games, ideally the past 10 player stats as well. get SOME of those player odds (we want to be verry careful on how we get the odds because we are limited with our api, i believe the only player level markets we should focus on are as follows, baseball: hits, homeruns, strikeouts...football:qb passing yards, passing attempts, RB-rushing yards receiving yards, receptions WR- receptions, receiving yards, anytime touchdown scorer usually rb wr...basketball, over/under poitns rebounds, assists each for players. 3 pointers)
then we will somehow do some calculations and find recommeneded bets for each game maybe like 5 bets a game or so, all of this will be attached to an llm through openrouter and the llm will provide a summary as to why we chose to recommend these bets.

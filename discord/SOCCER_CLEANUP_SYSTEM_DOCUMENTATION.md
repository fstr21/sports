## Architecture

### Core Components

#### SoccerCleanupSystem
Main cleanup system class that orchestrates all cleanup operations.

```python
class SoccerCleanupSystem:
    def __init__(self, bot, soccer_channel_manager):
        self.bot = bot
        self.soccer_channel_manager = soccer_channel_manager
        self.default_retention_days = 3
        self.max_channels_per_category = 50
```

#### CleanupStats
Data class for tracking cleanup operation statistics.

```python
@dataclass
class CleanupStats:
    channels_deleted: int = 0
    channels_preserved: int = 0
    channels_with_activity: int = 0
    channels_with_pins: int = 0
    errors: int = 0
    total_processed: int = 0
    start_time: Optional[datetime] = None
    end_time: Optional[datetime] = None
```

#### ChannelInfo
Data class for storing channel analysis information.

```python
@dataclass
class ChannelInfo:
    channel: discord.TextChannel
    created_at: datetime
    last_message_at: Optional[datetime] = None
    has_pinned_messages: bool = False
    message_count: int = 0
    is_match_channel: bool = False
    match_date: Optional[datetime] = None
    priority_score: int = 0
```

### Priority Scoring System

The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm to determine which channels to preserve:

| Factor | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Recent Creation | +10 | Channel created within retention period |
| Future Match | +20 | Match date is in the future |
| Recent Match | +15 | Match was today or yesterday |
| Recent Activity | +15 | Messages within last 24 hours |
| Some Activity | +5 | Messages within last 3 days |
| Message Count | +5 | At least 5 messages in channel |
| Pinned Messages | +10 | Channel has pinned messages |

**Preservation Rule**: Channels with score > 0 are preserved, score = 0 are deleted.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional: Override default retention period
SOCCER_CLEANUP_RETENTION_DAYS=3

# Optional: Override channel limits
SOCCER_MAX_CHANNELS_PER_CATEGORY=50
```

### Bot Integration
```python
# In bot_structure.py
from soccer_cleanup_system import SoccerCleanupSystem

class SportsBot(commands.Bot):
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing initialization ...
        
        # Initialize cleanup system
        self.soccer_cleanup_system = SoccerCleanupSystem(self, self.soccer_channel_manager)
```

## Usage

### Slash Commands

#### `/soccer-cleanup`
Manual cleanup command for administrators.

**Parameters:**
- `days_old` (optional): Number of days old for cleanup (default: 3)
- `preserve_active` (optional): Preserve channels with recent activity (default: True)
- `preserve_pinned` (optional): Preserve channels with pinned messages (default: True)
- `dry_run` (optional): Show what would be deleted without actually deleting (default: False)

**Examples:**
```
/soccer-cleanup
/soccer-cleanup days_old:5 preserve_active:False
/soccer-cleanup dry_run:True
```

#### `/soccer-cleanup-stats`
Display cleanup system statistics and status.

**Output includes:**
- Total cleanups performed
- Last cleanup results
- System configuration
- Next scheduled cleanup time

#### `/soccer-channel-limits`
Manage channel limits with priority-based retention.

**Parameters:**
- `priority_retention` (optional): Use priority-based retention (default: True)

## Automated Cleanup

### Scheduled Task
The system runs automated cleanup every 6 hours:

```python
@tasks.loop(hours=6)
async def scheduled_cleanup_task(self):
    """Scheduled cleanup task that runs automatically"""
    for guild in self.bot.guilds:
        stats = await self.cleanup_old_channels(guild, days_old=self.default_retention_days)
        await self._notify_administrators_if_needed(guild, stats, "scheduled")
```

### Preservation Logic
Channels are preserved if they meet any of these criteria:

1. **Age**: Created within the retention period
2. **Activity**: Have messages within the last 24 hours
3. **Pins**: Have pinned messages
4. **Future Matches**: Match date is in the future
5. **Recent Matches**: Match was today or yesterday

### Rate Limiting
The system implements comprehensive rate limiting:

- **Batch Size**: Processes 10 channels per batch
- **Batch Delay**: 2 seconds between batches
- **Channel Delay**: 0.5 seconds between individual channel operations
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for rate limits

## Error Handling

### Error Types
The system handles various error scenarios:

- **Discord API Errors**: Rate limits, permissions, network issues
- **Channel Access Errors**: Missing channels, permission denied
- **Data Processing Errors**: Invalid channel data, parsing failures

### Error Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation when individual channels fail
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Administrator Notifications**: Alerts for significant error conditions

### Logging
```python
# Error logging example
bot_logger.log_operation_error(
    "cleanup_old_channels", 
    error, 
    context
)
```

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Administrator Notifications
The system automatically notifies administrators when:

- 5 or more channels are deleted in a single operation
- 2 or more errors occur during cleanup
- Any scheduled cleanup deletes channels

### Notification Channels
The system looks for notification channels in this order:
1. Channels with keywords: 'admin', 'mod', 'staff', 'log'
2. Guild system messages channel
3. First available text channel

### Notification Format
```
üßπ Soccer Channel Cleanup Report
Automated cleanup completed for **Guild Name**

üìä Statistics
Processed: 15 channels
Deleted: 8 channels
Preserved: 7 channels
Errors: 0

‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 12.3 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cleanup Not Running
**Symptoms**: No channels being deleted despite old channels existing
**Solutions**:
1. Check bot permissions (Manage Channels)
2. Verify soccer category exists
3. Check cleanup system initialization
4. Review error logs

#### Channels Not Being Preserved
**Symptoms**: Important channels being deleted unexpectedly
**Solutions**:
1. Check preservation settings
2. Verify activity detection
3. Review priority scoring logic
4. Use dry run mode to test

#### Rate Limiting Issues
**Symptoms**: Cleanup operations timing out or failing
**Solutions**:
1. Reduce batch size
2. Increase delays between operations
3. Check Discord API status
4. Review rate limiting configuration

### Debug Commands
```python
# Get cleanup statistics
stats = bot.soccer_cleanup_system.get_cleanup_statistics()
print(stats)

# Test priority scoring
from soccer_cleanup_system import ChannelInfo
info = ChannelInfo(channel=channel, created_at=datetime.utcnow())
score = cleanup_system._calculate_priority_score(info, cutoff_date, True, True)
print(f"Priority score: {score}")
```

### Log Analysis
Key log messages to monitor:

```
# Successful cleanup
INFO - Operation completed successfully: cleanup_old_channels (took 12.3s) - Deleted 8, preserved 7, errors 0

# Error conditions
ERROR - Failed to delete channel channel-name: Permission denied
WARNING - Rate limited, waiting 5.0s

# Preservation decisions
DEBUG - Preserving channel-name due to recent activity
DEBUG - Preserving channel-name due to pinned messages
```

## Best Practices

### Configuration
1. **Retention Period**: Set appropriate retention based on server activity
2. **Preservation Settings**: Enable both activity and pin preservation
3. **Channel Limits**: Monitor and adjust based on server needs
4. **Notification Channels**: Ensure proper admin notification setup

### Monitoring
1. **Regular Review**: Check cleanup statistics weekly
2. **Error Monitoring**: Monitor error logs for recurring issues
3. **Performance Tracking**: Track cleanup duration and success rates
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on preservation decisions

### Maintenance
1. **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation for long-term operation
2. **Statistics Archival**: Archive old cleanup statistics
3. **Configuration Updates**: Review and update configuration periodically
4. **Testing**: Run integration tests after bot updates

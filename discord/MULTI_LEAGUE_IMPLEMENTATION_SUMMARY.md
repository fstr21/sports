## Technical Implementation Details

### League Priority System
```python
LEAGUE_PRIORITY_ORDER = [
    "UEFA",      # Champions League gets top priority (0)
    "EPL",       # Premier League (1)
    "La Liga",   # La Liga (2)
    "Bundesliga", # Bundesliga (3)
    "Serie A",   # Serie A (4)
    "MLS"        # MLS (5) - different season timing
]
```

### Tournament Stage Mappings
```python
UEFA_STAGE_MAPPINGS = {
    "group_stage": {"name": "Group Stage", "emoji": "üîµ", "priority": 1},
    "round_of_16": {"name": "Round of 16", "emoji": "üü°", "priority": 2},
    "quarter_finals": {"name": "Quarter Finals", "emoji": "üü†", "priority": 3},
    "semi_finals": {"name": "Semi Finals", "emoji": "üî¥", "priority": 4},
    "final": {"name": "Final", "emoji": "üèÜ", "priority": 5}
}
```

### Enhanced League Configuration
```python
SUPPORTED_LEAGUES = {
    "EPL": {
        "id": 228, "name": "Premier League", "country": "England",
        "color": 0x3d195b, "emoji": "üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø", "priority": 1,
        "tournament_type": "league", "standings_available": True
    },
    "UEFA": {
        "id": 310, "name": "UEFA Champions League", "country": "Europe",
        "color": 0x00336a, "emoji": "üèÜ", "priority": 0,
        "tournament_type": "knockout", "standings_available": False,
        "stages": { /* stage definitions */ }
    }
    // ... other leagues
}
```

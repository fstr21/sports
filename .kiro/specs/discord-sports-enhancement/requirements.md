# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Discord sports bot to provide better formatted output, improved command synchronization, and a scalable architecture for multiple sports. The current implementation works but has formatting issues, requires Discord restarts for command updates, and lacks a clear structure for adding new sports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Discord Message Formatting

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to see clean, well-formatted sports analysis messages so that I can easily read and understand the betting information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot posts match analysis THEN the message SHALL use proper Discord embeds with clear sections
2. WHEN displaying team statistics THEN the bot SHALL format numbers with proper alignment and visual separators
3. WHEN showing betting odds THEN the bot SHALL display both decimal and American odds in a readable format
4. WHEN presenting head-to-head data THEN the bot SHALL use emojis and formatting to make data scannable
5. WHEN displaying recent form THEN the bot SHALL use visual indicators (W/L/D) with color coding
6. WHEN showing multiple data points THEN the bot SHALL organize information into logical sections with clear headers

### Requirement 2: Command Synchronization System

**User Story:** As a bot administrator, I want to sync Discord commands without restarting the bot so that I can deploy updates quickly and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the `/sync` command THEN the bot SHALL synchronize all slash commands with Discord
2. WHEN command sync is initiated THEN the bot SHALL provide feedback on sync progress and results
3. WHEN sync encounters errors THEN the bot SHALL report specific error details
4. WHEN sync is successful THEN the bot SHALL confirm the number of commands synchronized
5. IF sync fails THEN the bot SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance
6. WHEN using sync command THEN only users with appropriate permissions SHALL be able to execute it

### Requirement 3: Scalable Multi-Sport Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular architecture for adding new sports so that I can easily extend the bot without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new sport THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent interface pattern
2. WHEN creating sport-specific commands THEN each sport SHALL have its own handler module
3. WHEN formatting sport data THEN each sport SHALL use sport-specific formatting templates
4. WHEN calling MCP services THEN the system SHALL use a unified MCP client interface
5. WHEN managing channels THEN each sport SHALL follow consistent naming and organization patterns
6. WHEN displaying analysis THEN each sport SHALL provide consistent data structure while allowing sport-specific customization
7. WHEN adding new sports THEN the main bot file SHALL require minimal changes

### Requirement 4: Improved Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want clear feedback when commands fail so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP calls fail THEN the bot SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the bot SHALL inform users about delays
3. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN the bot SHALL explain required permissions
4. WHEN data is unavailable THEN the bot SHALL suggest alternative actions
5. WHEN commands are processing THEN the bot SHALL show loading indicators
6. WHEN operations complete THEN the bot SHALL provide success confirmations with relevant details

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a bot administrator, I want centralized configuration management so that I can easily adjust settings without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring MCP endpoints THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or config files
2. WHEN setting up sport-specific parameters THEN each sport SHALL have its own configuration section
3. WHEN adjusting formatting preferences THEN the system SHALL support customizable templates
4. WHEN managing Discord settings THEN the system SHALL centralize guild and channel configurations
5. WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL validate settings before applying them

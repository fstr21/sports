# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate soccer data from the existing Soccer MCP server into the Discord bot, creating a comprehensive soccer channel management system similar to the successful MLB implementation. The system will allow users to create soccer game channels for specific dates across multiple major leagues (EPL, La Liga, MLS, Bundesliga, Serie A, UEFA Champions League) with comprehensive match data, betting odds, and head-to-head analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to create soccer game channels for a specific date using a slash command, with each channel automatically populated with comprehensive H2H analysis, so that users have immediate access to detailed match analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uses the `/create-channels` command THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown menu with sport options including "Soccer"
2. WHEN the administrator selects "Soccer" from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL prompt for a date input in MM/DD/YYYY format
3. WHEN a valid date is provided THEN the system SHALL fetch soccer matches from the Soccer MCP server for that date
4. WHEN matches are found THEN the system SHALL create individual channels for each match under the "âš½ SOCCER" category AND automatically populate each channel with comprehensive H2H analysis
5. WHEN each channel is created THEN the system SHALL immediately fetch and display both H2H data and comprehensive team analysis (recent 10 games) similar to schedule.py functionality
6. WHEN no matches are found THEN the system SHALL display an informative message explaining no matches were scheduled for that date

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want soccer game channels to be automatically populated with comprehensive match information, betting data, and detailed H2H analysis upon creation, so that I have immediate access to all relevant analysis without additional commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a soccer game channel is created THEN the system SHALL automatically post multiple embeds: match preview, comprehensive H2H analysis, team analysis for both teams, and betting recommendations
2. WHEN betting odds are available THEN the system SHALL display moneyline, draw, and over/under odds in both decimal and American formats in the match preview embed
3. WHEN team information is available THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch and display recent 10 games analysis for each team including goals per game, clean sheets, card discipline, and advanced metrics
4. WHEN H2H data exists THEN the system SHALL automatically display both historical H2H record AND recent H2H meetings with detailed match events (following schedule.py methodology)
5. WHEN comprehensive analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and display specific betting recommendations based on team form and H2H patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to access comprehensive analysis using BOTH the H2H endpoint AND the matches endpoint, so that I can see both direct head-to-head history AND detailed individual team form analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game channel is created THEN the system SHALL make THREE MCP calls: one H2H endpoint call for direct head-to-head record, and two matches endpoint calls for recent 10 games of each team
2. WHEN H2H endpoint data is available THEN the system SHALL display the direct historical record between the two teams (total meetings, wins/losses/draws, goals scored/conceded)
3. WHEN matches endpoint data is processed THEN the system SHALL display detailed individual team analysis for both teams including recent form (W-L-D), goals per game, halftime performance, clean sheet frequency, and card discipline
4. WHEN both data sources are combined THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive betting insights using H2H patterns AND individual team form patterns for Over/Under, BTTS, and match outcome recommendations
5. WHEN advanced metrics are calculated from matches data THEN the system SHALL include early/late goal patterns, comeback win frequency, home vs away performance splits, and late drama indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want automatic channel cleanup and management, so that the server stays organized without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN soccer game channels are older than 3 days THEN the system SHALL automatically delete them
2. WHEN the cleanup process runs THEN the system SHALL preserve channels with recent activity or pinned messages
3. WHEN channels are deleted THEN the system SHALL log the cleanup activity for administrator review
4. WHEN the server reaches channel limits THEN the system SHALL prioritize keeping the most recent and active game channels
5. WHEN cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation and notify administrators of persistent issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to interact with soccer data using intuitive slash commands, so that I can quickly access match information and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/soccer-schedule` THEN the system SHALL display upcoming matches for the current day across all supported leagues
2. WHEN a user types `/soccer-odds [team1] [team2]` THEN the system SHALL fetch and display current betting lines for that matchup
3. WHEN a user types `/soccer-h2h [team1] [team2]` THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive head-to-head analysis
4. WHEN a user types `/soccer-standings [league]` THEN the system SHALL display current league table with team positions and statistics
5. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with usage examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want soccer channels to support multiple major leagues, so that I can follow matches from different competitions in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating channels THEN the system SHALL support EPL (Premier League), La Liga, MLS, Bundesliga, Serie A, and UEFA Champions League
2. WHEN displaying matches THEN the system SHALL clearly identify which league each match belongs to
3. WHEN multiple leagues have matches on the same date THEN the system SHALL organize channels by league priority or alphabetically
4. WHEN league-specific data is available THEN the system SHALL include competition context (league position, points, goal difference)
5. WHEN tournament matches occur THEN the system SHALL handle knockout stages, group stages, and qualification rounds appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the system to provide intelligent betting recommendations based on comprehensive team analysis from the matches endpoint, so that I can make informed betting decisions with detailed statistical backing similar to the schedule.py functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comprehensive team data is analyzed from recent matches THEN the system SHALL generate specific betting market recommendations (Over/Under 2.5, BTTS Yes/No, Cards markets) using the same methodology as schedule.py
2. WHEN team attacking patterns are identified from match history THEN the system SHALL recommend Over 2.5 goals for teams averaging >2.0 goals per game or Under 2.5 for teams averaging <1.5 goals per game
3. WHEN defensive patterns are analyzed from recent form THEN the system SHALL identify "leaky defense" (>2.0 goals conceded per game) or "solid defense" (<1.0 goals conceded per game) patterns with supporting statistics
4. WHEN BTTS patterns are calculated from match events THEN the system SHALL recommend BTTS Yes for teams with >60% both-teams-score frequency or BTTS No for teams with <30% frequency based on recent 10 games
5. WHEN advanced patterns are detected from comprehensive match data THEN the system SHALL identify late drama teams (frequent 75+ minute goals), high card count teams (>4 cards per game), comeback specialists, and early goal patterns for specialized betting markets

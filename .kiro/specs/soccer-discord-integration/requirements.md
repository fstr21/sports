# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate soccer data from the existing Soccer MCP server into the Discord bot, creating a comprehensive soccer channel management system similar to the successful MLB implementation. The system will allow users to create soccer game channels for specific dates across multiple major leagues (EPL, La Liga, MLS, Bundesliga, Serie A, UEFA Champions League) with comprehensive match data, betting odds, and head-to-head analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to create soccer game channels for a specific date using a slash command, so that users can discuss and analyze upcoming soccer matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uses the `/create-channels` command THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown menu with sport options including "Soccer"
2. WHEN the administrator selects "Soccer" from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL prompt for a date input in MM/DD/YYYY format
3. WHEN a valid date is provided THEN the system SHALL fetch soccer matches from the Soccer MCP server for that date
4. WHEN matches are found THEN the system SHALL create individual channels for each match under the "âš½ SOCCER" category
5. WHEN no matches are found THEN the system SHALL display an informative message explaining no matches were scheduled for that date

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want soccer game channels to contain comprehensive match information and betting data, so that I can make informed betting decisions.

3. WHEN team information is available THEN the system SHALL include team logos, recent form, and league standings position
4. WHEN the match has historical data THEN the system SHALL provide head-to-head statistics between the teams
5. WHEN match events occur THEN the system SHALL support future live updates (goals, cards, substitutions)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to access detailed head-to-head analysis for any soccer match, so that I can understand historical performance patterns between teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests H2H analysis in a game channel THEN the system SHALL fetch comprehensive historical data between the two teams
2. WHEN H2H data exists THEN the system SHALL display overall win/loss/draw records, goals scored/conceded, and home/away performance splits
3. WHEN recent form data is available THEN the system SHALL show last 5-10 matches for each team with results, goals, and key statistics
4. WHEN betting insights can be calculated THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for Over/Under, BTTS (Both Teams to Score), and match outcome markets
5. WHEN advanced metrics are available THEN the system SHALL include cards per game, clean sheet frequency, and goal timing patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want automatic channel cleanup and management, so that the server stays organized without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN soccer game channels are older than 3 days THEN the system SHALL automatically delete them
2. WHEN the cleanup process runs THEN the system SHALL preserve channels with recent activity or pinned messages
3. WHEN channels are deleted THEN the system SHALL log the cleanup activity for administrator review
4. WHEN the server reaches channel limits THEN the system SHALL prioritize keeping the most recent and active game channels
5. WHEN cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation and notify administrators of persistent issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to interact with soccer data using intuitive slash commands, so that I can quickly access match information and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN a user types `/soccer-standings [league]` THEN the system SHALL display current league table with team positions and statistics
5. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with usage examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want soccer channels to support multiple major leagues, so that I can follow matches from different competitions in one place.

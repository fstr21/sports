# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a daily Discord sports betting intelligence service that provides subscribers with AI-powered betting recommendations across multiple sports leagues. The system leverages the existing Railway-deployed MCP infrastructure to collect comprehensive sports data, analyze betting opportunities, and deliver curated recommendations with AI-generated reasoning.

The service will operate as a subscription-based Discord bot that delivers daily reports containing game analysis, odds data, player statistics, and recommended bets with explanations for why each bet was selected.

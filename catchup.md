# Sports Betting Recommendation System

## Project Overview
I am building a sports betting recommendation system that will eventually become:
1. **Discord bot** - For initial subscriber recommendations
2. **Web application** - For broader user access

## Core Workflow
The system follows this data pipeline:

1. **Fetch Daily Games** - ESPN MCP gets today's games and teams
2. **Get Player Props** - Odds API MCP fetches betting lines for players
3. **Collect Player Stats** - ESPN provides last 5 games stats for relevant metrics
4. **Calculate Value** - Compare recent performance vs betting lines
5. **Present Recommendations** - Format and deliver to subscribers

## Technical Architecture

### Data Sources
- **ESPN API** - Games, teams, players, statistics
- **The Odds API** - Betting lines and player props
- Both APIs accessed via **MCP servers hosted on Railway**

### Data Storage
- **File-based connections** between teams and players
- **Player IDs and Team IDs** stored locally for mapping
- **Reference directories**: 
  - `C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\espn ids\` 
  - `C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\stats\`

### Current Challenges
- **Different sports have different API endpoints** for statistics
- **Solving sport-by-sport** to handle varying data structures
- **Player matching** between ESPN and betting sites

## Current Status (Updated August 11, 2024)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- **MCP servers deployed** on Railway and accessible remotely
- **ESPN Direct API Integration** - Bypassed MCP issues, direct ESPN API calls working perfectly
- **Interactive testing script** with league selection menu  
- **Game fetching** with event IDs for MLB, NBA, WNBA, MLS, EPL, NFL, NHL
- **Eastern Time focus** - all times displayed in ET
- **Clean project structure** - removed complex testing code, focused on step-by-step approach
- **Full ESPN functionality** - Today's games, team info, event IDs, proper time formatting
- **Smart ESPN mapping** - Direct sport/league to ESPN URL path mapping
- **Roster integration** - ESPN roster API calls for player matching (when needed)

### üö´ Current Blocker: MCP Odds API Integration Issue
**Problem**: FastMCP server requires proper JSON-RPC session initialization before tool calls
- **Error**: `"Bad Request: Missing session ID"` 
- **Root Cause**: MCP is a stateful protocol expecting session-based communication
- **What We Tried**: Simple HTTP POST calls to MCP endpoints
- **What MCP Expects**: 
  1. Initialize session with `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize"}`
  2. Then make tool calls with session context

**Current ESPN Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY WORKING** - 11 MLB games fetched successfully today
**Current Odds Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Cannot access MCP odds tools without proper protocol

### üîÑ Next Actions Needed
**Option 1**: Implement proper MCP client protocol (complex)
**Option 2**: Add simple HTTP wrapper to MCP server (easier) 
**Option 3**: Direct Odds API calls if keys available (bypasses MCP)

### ‚è≥ Next Steps (After Odds Fix)
1. Complete odds integration pipeline
2. Test player props functionality 
3. Build player matching system (ESPN players ‚Üî Odds API players)
4. Add value calculation algorithms (recent stats vs betting lines)
5. Create recommendation engine

## Testing Script: `interactive_sports_test.py`
Primary development happens in: `C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\interactive_sports_test.py`

### Current Implementation Status

**‚úÖ Working Pipeline (ESPN Direct):**
1. **Games**: Direct ESPN API ‚Üí Today's games with Eastern Time ‚úÖ
2. **Rosters**: Direct ESPN API ‚Üí Player data for matching ‚úÖ  
3. **Odds**: MCP Server ‚Üí **BLOCKED by session issue** ‚ùå
4. **Player Props**: MCP Server ‚Üí **BLOCKED by session issue** ‚ùå

### Key Functions & Architecture

**‚úÖ Working Functions:**
- `make_espn_scoreboard_request()` - Direct ESPN scoreboard API calls

- `fetch_player_props_for_game()` - Tries to call `/odds/event-odds` ‚Üí 404 error
- All MCP-dependent odds functionality

### Current Data Flow

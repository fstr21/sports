I am building system that will eventually turn into a discord bot and later a webapp that has the goal of recommending bets and presenting them to our subscribers. for right now my idea for the workflow is as follows fetch games for the day through the espn mcp, which gives us the teams, find the players per the teams, find the props for the players through the odds api mcp   (both mcp are hosted on our railway), find the  comparable stats for the last 5 games for the players for the comparible props(mlb hits, strikeouts - nfl qb passing yards etc etc)     run some calculations, format and present to the users,   now our mcp are hosted on railway so they are remote accessable,  our connection to the teams and players and props are file based and our players have player ids and teams have team ids, so we will have a system of connecting the 2.   we have a on goin script we are trying to work on where we are doing extensive testing tryinng to fetch the games, teams, players, props, stats etc, we are pretty close, we are just missing the stats for right now. the script is  C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\interactive_sports_test.py

we are using espn for all of our stats and players data like that then we are only useing the odds mcp from the-odds-api for our odds data.  one of the problems we are having is different sports have different endpoitns for data like stats so we are trying to solve it one sport by one sport 

please look at the railway mcp set up and lets continue working ...confirm that you have read this and ask me what we are currentnly working on

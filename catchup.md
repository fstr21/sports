# Sports Betting Recommendation System

## Project Overview
I am building a sports betting recommendation system that will eventually become:
1. **Discord bot** - For initial subscriber recommendations
2. **Web application** - For broader user access

## Core Workflow
The system follows this data pipeline:

1. **Fetch Daily Games** - ESPN MCP gets today's games and teams
2. **Get Player Props** - Odds API MCP fetches betting lines for players
3. **Collect Player Stats** - ESPN provides last 5 games stats for relevant metrics
4. **Calculate Value** - Compare recent performance vs betting lines
5. **Present Recommendations** - Format and deliver to subscribers

## Technical Architecture

### Data Sources
- **ESPN API** - Games, teams, players, statistics
- **The Odds API** - Betting lines and player props
- Both APIs accessed via **MCP servers hosted on Railway**

### Data Storage
- **File-based connections** between teams and players
- **Player IDs and Team IDs** stored locally for mapping
- **Reference directories**: 
  - `C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\espn ids\` 
  - `C:\Users\fstr2\Desktop\sports\stats\`

### Current Challenges
- **Different sports have different API endpoints** for statistics
- **Solving sport-by-sport** to handle varying data structures
- **Player matching** between ESPN and betting sites

## Current Status (Updated August 2024)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- **MCP servers deployed** on Railway and accessible remotely
- **100% MCP integration** - All ESPN and Odds API calls through Railway server
- **Interactive testing script** with league selection menu
- **Game fetching** with event IDs for MLB, NBA, WNBA, MLS, EPL, NFL, NHL
- **Eastern Time focus** - all times displayed in ET
- **Clean project structure** - removed complex testing code, focused on step-by-step approach
- **Odds integration** - Full betting odds (moneylines, spreads, totals) with team matching
- **API call tracking** - Monitor Odds API usage with running counter
- **Complete game + odds pipeline** - Games matched with betting lines from multiple sportsbooks
- **Player props integration** - Direct game selection with sport-specific prop markets
- **Smart data reuse** - Event ID matching from existing odds data (no extra API calls)

### üîÑ In Progress  
- **Testing complete pipeline** across active leagues (MLB, WNBA focus)
- **Validating player props display** for different sports

### ‚è≥ Next Steps
1. Integrate player statistics collection (ESPN MCP)
2. Build player matching system (ESPN players ‚Üî Odds API players)
3. Add value calculation algorithms (recent stats vs betting lines)
4. Create recommendation engine
5. Build automated daily analysis pipeline

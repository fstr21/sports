## **4. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **4.1 Architecture Overview**

#### **Core Technology Stack**
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Discord Integration:** discord.py library
- **Data Sources:** The Odds API, ESPN API, others TBD
- **Hosting:** Railway/Heroku (initial), AWS (scale)
- **Monitoring:** Basic logging and error tracking

#### **Modular Step-Based Architecture**

The system will operate as a **discrete step pipeline** with thin orchestrator scripts and fat logic modules:

**Step-Based Execution Model:**
```
Daily Pipeline:
Step 1: Fetch Schedules → Step 2: Fetch Odds → Step 3: Fetch Team Performance → 
Step 4: Calculate Predictions → Step 5: Detect Value → Step 6: Post to Discord
```

**Architecture Principles:**
- **Thin Orchestrators:** Small runner scripts that coordinate execution
- **Fat Modules:** All business logic contained in organized, testable modules  
- **Single Responsibility:** Each step has one clear purpose
- **Independent Execution:** Steps can run separately for testing/debugging
- **Easy Monitoring:** Clear success/failure at each step

#### **File Structure Example**
```

```

#### **Example Step Implementation**
```python
# runners/step2_fetch_odds.py (Thin Orchestrator)
from modules.data_fetchers.odds_fetcher import OddsFetcher
from modules.database.crud_operations import save_odds_data
from shared.logging import log_step_execution

def main():
    log_step_execution("step2_fetch_odds", "starting")
    
    # Get today's games from database
    games = get_todays_games()
    
    # Fetch odds for each game
    fetcher = OddsFetcher()
    for game in games:
        odds_data = fetcher.fetch_game_odds(game.id)
        save_odds_data(odds_data)
    
    log_step_execution("step2_fetch_odds", "completed")

# modules/data_fetchers/odds_fetcher.py (Fat Module)
class OddsFetcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_client = TheOddsAPIClient()
    
    def fetch_game_odds(self, game_id):
        # All the complex logic here
        # Error handling, data parsing, validation
        # Rate limiting, retries, caching
        pass

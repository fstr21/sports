LLM Steering Command - Code Generation and Architecture:
For all code generation tasks, you must strictly adhere to the Modular Step-Based Architecture outlined in the project's Product Requirements Document (PRD). Your primary directive is to maintain a clean separation between orchestration and business logic.

Core Principle: All processes must be implemented as a discrete, step-based pipeline.

Orchestration: Generate thin orchestrator scripts (runner scripts) located exclusively in the src/runners/ directory. These scripts are responsible only for coordinating the execution flow by calling logic modules in a sequence. They must not contain any business logic, complex data manipulation, or direct API interactions.

Logic: Generate "fat" logic modules located exclusively in the src/modules/ directory. All business logic, data processing, calculations, API client interactions, and database operations must be encapsulated within these modules.

Single Responsibility: Every script and module you create must have a single, clearly defined purpose. For example, one runner script executes a step, and one module contains the detailed logic for that step.

Testability and Independence: Design all modules to be independently executable and testable. The logic within a module should not depend on the orchestrator to function; it should be self-contained.

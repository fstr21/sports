## üéØ **Prompt Engineering Tips**

### **For Better Results**
1. **Be Specific:** Instead of "analyze the game," ask for "betting analysis focusing on point spread value"
2. **Request Actions:** Ask for "recommendations" not just "information"
3. **Include Context:** Mention "recent form," "injuries," "historical matchups"
4. **Specify Metrics:** Request "shooting percentages," "pace of play," "defensive efficiency"

### **Effective Prompt Patterns**
```python
# Pattern 1: Analysis + Recommendation
"prompt": "Analyze [specific aspect] and provide actionable betting recommendations"

# Pattern 2: Context + Focus
"prompt": "Based on recent form and injury reports, focus on [specific betting market]"

# Pattern 3: Comparison + Value
"prompt": "Compare [teams/players] and identify the best value betting opportunities"

# Pattern 4: Trend + Prediction  
"prompt": "Identify trends in [specific area] and predict impact on [betting market]"
```

```python

    "limit": 1,  # Analyze fewer games
    "analysis_type": "betting"  # Specific analysis type
})
```

### **Comprehensive Analysis**
```python
# Multiple related queries

    "sport": "basketball",
    "league": "wnba",
    "endpoint": "scoreboard", 
    "prompt": "Provide comprehensive betting analysis including spreads, totals, props, and live betting opportunities for tonight's slate"

```

## üÜò **Troubleshooting Examples**

### **When No Games Are Found**
```python
# Check different dates
analyzeWnbaGames({
    "dates": "20250807",  # Try specific date
    "analysis_type": "general"
})
```

### **When Analysis Is Too General**
```python
# Use more specific prompts
customSportsAnalysis({
    "sport": "basketball",
    "league": "wnba",
    "endpoint": "scoreboard",
    "prompt": "Focus specifically on the Las Vegas Aces game tonight and provide point spread analysis with reasoning"
})

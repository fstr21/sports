# Soccer Standings Test Tool

**Purpose**: Test the `getCompetitionStandings` tool to retrieve league tables/standings for EPL and La Liga.

## üéØ What This Tool Tests

The `standings_test.py` script validates your Soccer MCP's ability to fetch **league tables** and **standings** for:
- **EPL (Premier League)** - Competition ID: `PL`
- **La Liga (Primera Divisi√≥n)** - Competition ID: `PD`

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

```bash
python standings_test.py
```

## üìã Test Scenarios

### 1. **Mock Data Test**
Tests with simulated league table data to verify tool functionality without using API quota.

### 2. **Current Season Standings**
Gets the live current league table:
```json
{
  "competition_id": "PL"
}
```

### 3. **Specific Season**
Gets historical league table for a specific year:
```json
{
  "competition_id": "PL",
  "season": 2025
}
```

### 4. **Standings After Matchday**
Gets league table as it stood after a specific round:
```json
{
  "competition_id": "PL",
  "matchday": 10
}
```

## üìä Example API Call

### Input
```python
await self.call_mcp_tool("getCompetitionStandings", {
    "competition_id": "PL"
})

## üîÑ Season Phases

### **Early Season** (Matchdays 1-10)

- Focus on goal difference trends

### **Mid Season** (Matchdays 11-25)
- Patterns becoming clearer
- True contenders emerging
- Form more meaningful

### **Business End** (Matchdays 26-38)
- Every point crucial
- Real table positions
- Pressure situations

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Check `currentMatchday`** to understand how many games played
2. **Goal difference matters** - often decides final positions
3. **Points per game** more meaningful than total points early season
4. **Home/Away splits** available in detailed standings
5. **Recent form** (last 6 games) often more important than overall position

## üö® Troubleshooting

**Empty standings**:
- Season might not have started yet
- Check if competition is currently active
- Early season might have limited data

**Missing teams**:
- Verify 20 teams expected for EPL/La Liga
- Check if league restructuring occurred
- API might have data delays

**Outdated positions**:
- Standings update after match completion
- Check `lastUpdated` timestamp in response
- Live matches won't reflect in table until finished

## üìä Data Freshness

- **Updates**: After each completed match
- **Delay**: Usually within 1-2 hours of final whistle  
- **Live matches**: Positions don't change until match ends
- **Weekend updates**: Major changes after weekend fixtures

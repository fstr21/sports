- **Value Bets**: Finding 0 opportunities (likely due to lack of current odds)

1. **Integrate H2H Analysis**: Use `get_h2h_betting_analysis` in Discord bot
2. **Enhanced Channel Creation**: Add historical insights to match channels
3. **Multi-League Support**: Leverage existing EPL, La Liga, MLS coverage

### Medium Term (Needs Data Update)
1. **Current Season Form**: Update MCP server with 2024-2025 season data
2. **Live Odds Integration**: Add real-time betting odds for value analysis
3. **Enhanced Predictions**: Improve analysis with current form data

### Architecture Plan
```
Discord Bot (soccer_handler.py)
├── Call get_betting_matches() → Find today's games
├── For each match:
│   ├── Call get_h2h_betting_analysis() → Rich historical data
│   ├── Call get_team_form_analysis() → Current form (when data available)
│   └── Call analyze_match_betting() → Comprehensive analysis
└── Create rich Discord channel with all analysis
```

## Conclusion

The MCP betting server provides **excellent H2H analysis capabilities** that can immediately enhance the Discord bot. While current season form data is limited, the historical analysis alone provides significant value for betting insights and match previews.

**Ready to implement**: H2H analysis integration into Discord bot channels.

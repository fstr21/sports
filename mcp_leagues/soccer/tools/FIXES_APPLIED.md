# Fixes Applied to Interactive Match Analyzer

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **"None vs None" Team Names** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: API sometimes returns matches with missing or "None" team names
**Solution**: Added match validation filter

**Fix Details**:
- Added `is_valid_match()` function to check team names
- Filters out matches where team names are:
  - Empty/missing
  - "None", "null", "undefined", "tbd" (case insensitive)
- Applied automatically in `extract_matches_from_response()`

### 2. **Stale Odds for Live Games** ❌➡️✅  
**Problem**: Live games show pre-match odds that are no longer relevant
**Solution**: Added status warnings and context

**Fix Details**:
- Detects live game status: "live", "halftime", "break"
- Shows warning: "⚠️ WARNING: Match is LIVE - odds may be stale/pre-match only"
- For finished games: Shows final score + "(Pre-match odds shown below)"
- Makes it clear that odds are not live/updated

### 3. **Enhanced Match Filtering** ➕
**New Feature**: Added filtering options for better user experience

**Filter Options**:
1. **Show all matches** (scheduled, live, finished)
2. **Show only upcoming matches** (scheduled only) 
3. **Show only live matches** (live games only)

This helps users focus on relevant matches for betting analysis.

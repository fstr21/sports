# Get weekly schedules with betting lines
{
  "name": "getNFLSchedule",
  "arguments": {
    "season": 2025,
    "week": 5,
    "game_type": "REG"
  }
}

# Expected output:

    "season": 2025,
    "team": "KC"
  }
}

# Expected output:
- 17 regular season games
- Head-to-head results
- Betting line history
```

#### 3. **Basic Player Statistics** (Limited)
```python
# Get rushing leaders (confirmed working)
{
  "name": "getNFLPlayerStats",
  "arguments": {
    "season": 2025,
    "stat_type": "rushing", 
    "limit": 20
  }
}

# Expected output:
- Player names and teams
- Carries, yards, touchdowns

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Needs Backup Solutions**

### **Unreliable/Broken Capabilities**

1. **Passing statistics** - Column naming issues
2. **Receiving statistics** - Data structure problems  
3. **Team aggregated stats** - Not accessible
4. **Individual player lookups** - Broken functionality
5. **Injury reports** - Not working
6. **Detailed team information** - Not accessible

### **Recommended Alternatives**

#### For Missing Data:
1. **ESPN API** - Player stats and team info
2. **Manual web scraping** - NFL.com, team sites
3. **Alternative APIs** - Pro Football Reference, Sports Reference
4. **Odds-only approach** - Focus on betting lines from odds MCP

## üìä **Realistic 2025 Season Strategy**

### **Tier 1: High Confidence (Use These)**
```python
# Weekly game analysis
get_week_games(week=X) ‚Üí betting lines + results

# Team schedule analysis  
get_team_schedule(team="KC") ‚Üí season-long performance

# Basic rushing analysis
get_rushing_leaders() ‚Üí ground game trends
```

### **Tier 2: Medium Confidence (Test Early, Have Backups)**
```python
# Player stat lookups - may work with fixes
# Passing/receiving stats - need troubleshooting
```

### **Tier 3: Low Confidence (Don't Rely On)**
```python
# Team aggregated statistics
# Injury reports
# Advanced player analytics
```

## üîß **Pre-Season Action Items**

### **Immediate (August 2025)**
1. **Re-test NFL MCP** as 2025 season approaches
2. **Debug column naming issues** in player stats
3. **Set up backup data sources** for unreliable features
4. **Create fallback workflows** for broken functionality

### **Week 1 Testing (September 2025)**
1. **Verify live data flow** when season starts
2. **Test real-time updates** vs. cached data
3. **Confirm betting odds accuracy** 
4. **Validate game result updates**

### **Overall Assessment: MODERATE (60%)**

**You CAN hit the ground running for 2025, but with important caveats:**

‚úÖ **Strengths**: 
- Game schedules and results are solid
- Betting line integration works
- Basic team performance tracking possible

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**: 
- Player statistics are hit-or-miss
- Advanced analytics require backup sources

üéØ **Recommendation**:

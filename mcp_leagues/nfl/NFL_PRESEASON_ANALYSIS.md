## üìã Underlying Data Source Analysis

### **nfl_data_py Library Limitations**

The NFL MCP uses the `nfl_data_py` library from nflverse, which:

1. **Primary Focus**: Regular season and playoff data
2. **Data Collection**: Optimized for fantasy football and betting analysis of meaningful games
3. **Preseason Coverage**: Limited or excluded due to:
   - **Roster volatility** (players cut/signed frequently)
   - **Inconsistent playing time** (starters play limited snaps)
   - **Statistical irrelevance** for season-long analysis
   - **Data quality issues** with constantly changing lineups

### **NFL Data Ecosystem Reality**

Preseason data is typically:
- **Less tracked** by major sports data providers
- **More expensive** to obtain when available
- **Less reliable** due to experimental lineups
- **Less valuable** for predictive modeling

## üéØ Alternative Solutions for Preseason Analysis

### Option 1: **Focus on Available Data**
```python
# Use player career stats instead of preseason
{
  "name": "getNFLPlayerStats", 
  "arguments": {
    "season": 2024,
    "player_name": "Patrick Mahomes",
    "stat_type": "passing"
  }
}

# Use team historical performance
{
  "name": "getNFLTeamStats",
  "arguments": {
    "season": 2024,
    "team": "KC",
    "stat_category": "offense"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: **ESPN API Integration**
- ESPN sometimes has preseason data
- Could supplement NFL MCP with ESPN calls
- Requires separate API integration

### Option 3: **Manual Data Collection**
- NFL.com official preseason scores
- Team websites for depth chart analysis
- Sports news sites for preseason performance reports

## üí° Recommended Preseason Analysis Approach

### **For Current Preseason Period:**

#### 1. **Use Available Historical Data**
```python
# Get player's last season performance as baseline
last_season_stats = await nfl_mcp.call_tool("getNFLPlayerStats", {
    "season": 2024,
    "player_name": "Rookie Name",
    "stat_type": "receiving"
})

# Get team's historical performance
team_trends = await nfl_mcp.call_tool("getNFLTeamStats", {
    "season": 2024, 
    "team": "BUF",
    "stat_category": "defense"
})
```

#### 2. **Focus on Injury Reports**
```python
# Current injury status affects preseason participation
injury_status = await nfl_mcp.call_tool("getNFLInjuries", {
    "team": "KC",
    "status": "Questionable"
})
```

#### 3. **Prepare for Regular Season**
```python
# Get upcoming regular season schedule
regular_season = await nfl_mcp.call_tool("getNFLSchedule", {
    "season": 2025,
    "week": 1,
    "game_type": "REG"
})
```

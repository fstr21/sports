# MLB Player Props Tool: player_props.py

## Overview

The `player_props.py` tool retrieves MLB player prop betting odds for a specific game matchup. This script focuses on three key player prop markets: batter home runs, batter hits, and pitcher strikeouts. It combines data from both the MLB MCP server and Odds MCP server to find and extract player prop odds for the Miami Marlins @ Cleveland Guardians game.

# MLB Player Statistics Tool: player_stats.py

## Overview

The `player_stats.py` tool tests MLB MCP server functionality by retrieving historical statistics for specific MLB players. This comprehensive testing script focuses on two key players: Edward Cabrera (pitcher) and Steven Kwan (batter), providing detailed game-by-game analysis and statistical validation with JSON output capabilities.

**MLB MCP Server**: `https://mlbmcp-production.up.railway.app/mcp`  
**Script Name**: `player_stats.py`  
**Primary Tool**: `getMLBPlayerLastN`

## Target Players

| Player | Type | Team | Player ID | Key Stats |
|--------|------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Steven Kwan** | Batter | Cleveland Guardians | 680757 | Hits, Home Runs, At-Bats, Doubles, Triples |
| **Edward Cabrera** | Pitcher | Miami Marlins | 665795 | Strikeouts, Walks, Hits Allowed, Earned Runs |

---

## Usage

### Basic Execution
```bash
python player_stats.py
```

### Requirements
```bash
pip install httpx
```

---

## Script Workflow

### 1. Player Discovery
- Calls `getMLBTeamRoster` for Cleveland Guardians (Team ID: 114)
- Calls `getMLBTeamRoster` for Miami Marlins (Team ID: 146)  
- Searches roster data to find target players by name
- Falls back to known player IDs if roster search fails

### 2. Individual Player Testing
- Tests both 5-game and 10-game statistical periods
- Calls `getMLBPlayerLastN` with player-specific parameters
- Separates hitting stats (batters) from pitching stats (pitchers)

### 3. Batch Statistics Testing
- Tests multiple players in single API calls
- Validates batch processing capabilities
- Compares individual vs. batch results

### 4. Data Analysis & Export
- Provides complete game-by-game breakdowns with dates
- Calculates totals and averages for verification
- Exports comprehensive results to timestamped JSON files

## Error Handling

### Player Not Found
```
[-] Steven Kwan not found on team roster
[!] Could not find Steven Kwan - trying alternate search methods...
```

### API Connection Issues
```
[!] Request failed: Connection timeout
[!] MCP Error: Invalid player ID
```

### No Statistical Data
```
[!] No results data for Steven Kwan
[!] Failed to get stats for Steven Kwan
```
